<p>Welcome to my homepage for my coding modules at the University of Leeds. I am currently studying a Msc in GIS and I elected to take both Web-based GIS and Programming for GIS
analysis to help broaden my skillset. I have had a keen interest in GIS ever since I first encountered it 4 years ago during my undergraduate studies.  </p>

</br><p>Past academic projects I have worked from include, quantifying peat erosion rates in the Forest of Bowland, conducting a viewshed analysis for wind turbine proposals in Scotland and measuring deprivation
in the Yorkshire administrative boundary.  </p>

</br><p>In the banner above you will find links for all the work I have completed for my module thus far.Visit my github if you have an interest in the source code which went into creating this webpage. </p>

<p>Hurricane Sandy was a severe tropical storm which hit the northeastern US coastline on October 29, 2012 (Kryvasheyeu et al., 2015). It was the largest hurricane of the 2012 season and still remains one of the most costly natural disasters in the United States history (Kryvasheyeu et al., 2015). It is thought that the total
capital cost of Sandy was around $50 billion and that there were 147 direct casualties (Kryvasheyeu et al., 2015). A state by state breakdown of social cost in the US can be observed in the table below.
