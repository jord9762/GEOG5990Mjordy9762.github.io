1. Download code from https://github.com/jord9762/Leeds_coding_assessments as a zip file.
2. Extract to directory of your choice and ensure all files are present.
3. Open up code editor of your choice (in my case Spyder version 5.0.4) and navigate to chosen directory using a combination of cd.. and pwd.
4. Select learning.py and click run, a tkinter gui with a blue button and green background should appear. Cliclick run model and this should illustrate the method whereby drunks move as well as the density trail they leave behind. This can be executed consecutively.
5. Restart kernel and select final_model.py and click run. This should have provided two figures in the plot pane with one showing density and one showing the drunks in their homes. Furthermore a new txt file should have been written into your working directory which has been given the name density.txt
6. Enjoy!!
