<b>Note: This code was ran in Spyder verson 5.0.4, all code except proto_model.py works as intended. If access to Spyder version 5.0.4 is impossible please use a Jupyter notebook. If using a Jupyter notebook ensure all files are in the same directory. </b>
<h4>Instructions.md</h4>
<p>Displays instructions on how to run the final version of the drunks model (please refer to this if struggling to get code to run.).</p>
<h4>drunk.txt</h4>
<p>Environment data which displayed information regarding the home locations.</p>
<h4>drunkframework.py</h4>
<p>Held the Drunk class which contained functions for the drunks relating to environment, location within environment and current store. (Assessed code)</p>
<h4>final_model.py</h4>
<p>Held the code for executing the final model which would show drunks traverse the environment found in drunk.txt until they found their home. The file named density.txt would 
also be printed showing the areas where the drunks travelled throughout the iterations. (Assessed code)</p>
<h4>learning.py</h4>
<p>The code learning.py is a file which helps the user understand the underlying processes occuring in final_model.py. This helped tremendously in the development process as it helped visualise how agents traversed the environment as well as the effect this had. (Assessed code)</p>
<h4>proto_model.py</h4>
<p>This code was just an earlier version of final_model.py where I made the mistake of combining the process of tracking the density and traversing the environment, therefore the values of the environment changed thus distorting the identification/home process. Kept in for an context regarding the development of this project. (Non-assessed code) </p>
