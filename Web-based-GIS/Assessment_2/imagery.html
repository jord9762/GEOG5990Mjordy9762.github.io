<b> Pharaoh’s Castle:</b><br/>

<b> Temple Church:</b><br/>
The influence of the Knights Templar was far reaching and their exploits allowed them to amass such wealth that they bought large islands such as Cyprus for their own leisure. By the mid-12th century saw the construction of the Temple Church which would serve as the headquarters for the London chapter of the Knights Templar. The Temple Church was a round church based off the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, there are only three other churches modelled this way in Britain. The nave of the church has a fortress like aesthetic likely reflecting the Templars combination between religion and warfare. The allegations of devil worship were ultimately thrown at the Templar Order leading to the dissolution of the Templars in 1312 (Ruggeri, 2016).

The creek would be used again in the third crusade highlighting its significance within the crusade era.

<b> Clermont:</b><br/>
Clermont held significance among all of the crusades as it was the location which sparked their inception. The Council of Clermont saw Pope Urban II call the first crusade in the year of 1095 November 18th. The request which sparked the council was made by Emperor Alexius I Comnenus to aid the Greeks against the Muslim Turks. The Pope implored the French knights in Clermont to "save" the "Holy Land" from the Turks. Urban II closed his assembly speech with the words god wills it and this became the battle cry of all crusaders (Britannica, 2021).

<b> Grandmaster Palace - Rhodes:</b><br/>
The Grandmaster Palace in Rhodes served as the primary headquarters for the Hospitaller Knights. Despite being a bastion for the Hospitaller Knights it was also allegedly somewhat of a vault (Borowski and Gerrard, 2017). The Knights Hospitaller were thought to have acquired many holy relics such as thorns from the crown of thorns, the thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas and the relics of Saint Anthony (Borowski and Gerrard, 2017). </p>

<p>
<b> Chateau Pelerin:</b><br/>
Chateau Pelerin was one of the most famous and successful Templar castles and its name roughly translates to Castle Pilgrim. There were thought to be around 4000 troops located here during the peak of Templar occupation. One of the most ingenious design choices of this castle was its unique double wall. As the inner wall was taller than the outer wall it allowed defenders to shoot down on attackers while also preventing breaches of the castle walls. As a result of this Chateau Pelerin withstood many sieges.</p>

<p>
<b> Acre:</b><br/>
Under the Frankish kings Acre was widely regarded as the richest town in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, as such it had extreme political importance for the Crusader forces. By 1187 it was taken by Saladin, Saladin often visited Acre to assess the damages caused by his troops during the siege of Acre. Despite being an impressive city Acre is largely marred in atrocity due to its central role in the crusades with the most prominent being Richard III''s massacre of more than 3000 innocents on the 20th August 1191.</p>

During 2016 the shrine of Edicule was opened for the first time in modern history to undergo reparations, the marble found inside were dated back to around 345 AD.</p>

<b> Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif:</b><br/>
Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif is a highly controversial place of worship as it has significant Jewish and Muslim reverence. It is thought to be the holiest site in all of Judaism.

<p>
<b> Messina Port:</b><br/>
Located in Italy Messina port was of significant value in the crusades as the Templars and Hospitallers influence meant it was a stable base to ship supplies to the Holy Land (Bronstein, 2018). While a variety of cargo type was thought to be shipped from Messina port it was primarily famous for shipping horses over to aid the Knights fighting in the Holy Land (Bronstein, 2018)..

<b> Castello Della Magione:</b><br/>
The Castello Della Magione is a Templar castle situated in Tuscany, Italy. While looking fairly inconspicuous in present day this was actually the site of a former church used to house Templar pilgrims on their way to Rome.

<p>
<b> Ajloun Castle:</b><br/>
Ajloun castle was a grand fortress commissioned by Saladin and built by his nephew Izz al-Din Usama. The primary goal of the fortress was to serve as a military deterrent for the Frankish forces who were edging closer into Saladin's territories. Ajloun Castle lost much of its significance after the fall of Karak and was only used as a means to secure important trade routes into Syria. The castle saw another rise to prominence in future hostilities between the Mamluks and the Mongols. </p>

<p>
<b> Citadel of Salah Ed-Din:</b><br/>
This fortress was also known as Saladin castle and has been used as a fortification perhaps dating back to Phoenician control and later by Alexander the Great. After being developed further by the Byzantines the stronghold fell to Saladin during 1188. The citadel is recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site as of 2006. Following the capture orchestrated by Saladin a palace, mosque and series of baths were developed in keeping with popular Arabic architecture. </p>

<b> Arwad:</b><br/>
Arwad is an island located 3km away from Tartus (Syria) and is thought to have dated back to around 2nd millennium BC.

<b> Chastel Blanc:</b><br/>
The castle of Safita (Chastel Blanc) was a Templar stronghold in Syria, due to being situated near the coast it would have had significant strategic importance. During 1271 it fell to Mamluk control and was almost completely destroyed. Its original layout is difficult to ascertain due to the extent it was damaged (Kázmér and Major, 2015). </p>

<b> Qal’at Salah El-Din:</b><br/>
The fortress of Saladin despite being in partly ruin is testament to the architectural brilliance of some of the fortresses and castles during the crusader period. The fortress was initially built by the Byzantines but the fortress underwent improvement following subsequent Frankish and Ayyubid occupations.

<b> Margat Castle:</b><br/>
The Margat Castle or Qalʿat al-Marqab is one of the largest forts in Syria and overlooks the Mediterranean sea from a triangular volcanic plateau (Edbury et al., 2020). As its 360m above sea level it would have held a significant strategic advantage in the event of a siege. Despite its grandiose there is almost no history regarding its occupation and construction (Edbury et al., 2020). </p>

<b> Damascus:</b><br/>
Damascus is the capital of Syria and has often been referred to as the pearl of the east due to its beauty. The origin of Damascus is dubious as even its name "Dimashka" is a word thought to have originated in a time before pre-recorded history. During 1148 a siege occurred in Damascus which ultimately set up the failure of subsequent crusades as Christian influence was limited to small city states surrounded by superior Muslim numbers.</p>

<b> Constantinople:</b><br/>
Constantinople or Istanbul as it is known presently has been at the heart of religious conflict between Europe and Asia for more than 2500 years. During 1204 Constantinople was sacked in what was described by many as an act fuelled by greed rather than principle. Many historians claim that the sacking of Constantinople highlights that the 4th crusade was distracted from its purpose early on. Once the city was breached the crusaders pillaged and looted what was commonly referred as "The greatest city in Christendom". </p>

<b> Hagia Sophia:</b><br/>
The Hagia Sophia was built by Christian architects nearly 1500 years ago and is widely regarded as one of the longest enduring symbols of Constantinople. The two major influences in terms of worship have been Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
