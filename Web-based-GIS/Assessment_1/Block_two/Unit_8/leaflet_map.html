<p>Hurricane Sandy was a severe tropical storm which hit the northeastern US coastline on October 29, 2012 (Kryvasheyeu et al., 2015). It was the largest hurricane of the 2012 season and still remains one of the most costly natural disasters in the United States history (Kryvasheyeu et al., 2015). It is thought that the total
capital cost of Sandy was around $50 billion and that there were 147 direct casualties (Kryvasheyeu et al., 2015). A state by state breakdown of social cost in the US can be observed in the table below.
